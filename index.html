    <h2>About Persichetti &amp; Associates, LLC</h2>

    <p>
      Persichetti &amp; Associates is an independent actuarial advisory practice focused on helping organizations
      across the healthcare system make clear, well-supported strategic decisions. Led by Thomas Persichetti,
      the firm provides senior-level judgment, economic insight, and independent analysis to clients seeking clarity
      in complex or high-stakes environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      With more than 25 years of experience spanning employers, providers, health plans, advisory firms, and
      healthcare startups, I work closely with leaders who want to understand the financial and strategic implications
      of their choices. My role is to translate data, economics, and regulatory context into decisions and trade-offs
      that executives, boards, and fiduciaries can defend with confidence.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;">How I work</h3>
    <p>I intentionally maintain a small, focused client list. That means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You work directly with a senior actuarial partner, not a leveraged team.</li>
      <li>Every engagement is independent and unconflicted—no networks, products, or vendor incentives.</li>
      <li>Analyses are transparent, grounded in economics, and tailored to your environment.</li>
      <li>Outputs are built for decision-makers: clear options, clear implications, and defensible rationale.</li>
    </ul>
